# conf.yml â€” single source of truth for target hostnames and their redirect IPs
#
# Schema:
# targets:
#   - host: host1.example.com
#     ips:
#       - 203.0.113.10   # first IP is used for proxying
#   - host: host2.example.com
#     ips:
#       - 198.51.100.20
#
# Notes:
# - All listed hosts will be resolved (via dnsmasq) to the internal NGINX container IP
#   so that clients hit NGINX first. NGINX then proxies each host to its configured
#   backend IP over HTTPS.
# - The internal NGINX container IP defaults to 172.30.0.3.
